<h2>New Project: Tiny Lang</h2>
<p><br />

Yes, its another compiler project. Actually, unlike my other projects, this one has a start, stop, and purpose.
<br /><br />
Tiny Lang is a programming language specification and reference implementation all forked (more like "down-forked") from my Orka compiler project. It began shortly after my Christmas break from school started. I was doing some hardware projects, and needed a basic compiler. As I was getting rather tired of implementing things over and over again, and because I didn't have a compiler project that was suitable without substantial modifications, I decided to create a spec and a project that could form the base for future projects. And so Tiny Lang was born.
<br /><br />
I also have a secondary goal that it can be used as a learning tool. Because the language is very simple, the implementation by consequence is simple. I hope this can be something people interesting in compilers can use.
<br /><br />
You can find source code with examples <a href="https://github.com/pflynn157/tiny-lang">here</a>, and the project page <a href="/tiny-lang.html">here on my site</a>.
<br /><br />
<h3>Version 0.1</h3>
<br /><br />
This is version 0.1 of the language and the implementation. While I think I'm mostly done with the language itself, the implementation inherited a number of problems from Orka, must notably bad syntax checking problems. This is on my to-do list, but I really want to go back to something else I was experimenting with, and I doubt anyone else is going to be using this in the near future, so I'll fix it later.
<br /><br />
In short, this means if you are programming in Tiny, and its doing weird things, check and re-check your code :)
