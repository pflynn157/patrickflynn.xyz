<h2>Why Compilers?</h2>
<p><br />

You may be wondering, of all the areas of computer science, how did I end up going into compilers?
<br /><br />
This question is actually a little hard for me to answer because I don't really remember how I began. Or why. I started down my compiler path over the summer before college by writing a simple BASIC interpreter. But even then, parsing wasn't new to me. My last project before the BASIC interpreter was a spreadsheet application. It included formulas, which required some fair knowledge of parsing. I ended up applying this to write the interpreter since parsing a mathematical spreadsheet formula isn't terribly different from a variable expression.
<br /><br />
Now that I've thought about it, I think it stems from two areas: my strong interest in programming languages, and my equally strong interest in hardware architectures.
<br /><br />
If you scroll through my Github page, you will notice that I've played with a lot of languages. Yes, most of what's there is C++, but I have tried to make things in other languages. Over the past year of covid19, I've dived deeper into this, trying some new languages including Ada and Rust. But I don't only like to try languages. I like to design my own to. To me, there's very little as satisfying as designing a language, implementing it, and seeing a program written in it build and run like any other program on your computer. And its also very challenging. You may think its easy to design a language, but when you start trying to write anything more complicated than "Hello World", you'll realize this isn't so.
<br /><br />
I also love working close to the hardware. I really like doing things in assembly, but I don't love writing it. Therefore, I write a compiler to do it for me. I find hardware architectures very interesting- basically how the machine works and does things. I also find it really interesting how a certain programming construct can map to a hardware instruction (or some cases, a group of instructions). Pretty much all my compilers predominately target x86, but I have targeted Arm and RISC-V in the past, which was a lot of fun.
<br /><br />
All areas of computer science have merit, and even if you aren't in compilers, you may have different reasons for why you chose your area. But this is why I love this area so much.
