<h2>New Projects & Updates</h2>
<p><br />

Hello everyone! It's been a while since I've written. Observant users may have noticed that I changed my site's theme, but other than that I haven't done much. April was a very busy and at times challenging month, so I decided to focus on school and other things.
<br /><br />
The biggest piece of news is that I pushed a lot of stuff to Github. Some of it was updates to existing projects, but I also have a few new ones: a small lexical analyzer generator, a simple x86-64 assembler, and LLIR, an LLVM-like backend. I have documentation sitting around which I need to merge in with the rest the project info here on my site. I should probably do separate posts as I upload each project, but that will be later.
<br /><br />
Over the past month, I've been making an effort to scale back some. Near the end of April, I started to approach a burnout point between school, work, and trying to do too many projects at once. A lot of these projects that I pushed were part of a larger project that I was working on, but decided to shelve for the moment and start over. This is largely the conclusion of an earlier post that I wrote about gutting my Github profile. Now that school is winding down and summer is approaching, I'm making an effort to be more intentional about how much I take on. A large part of that includes not doing too many projects, and focusing on a limited set of things at a time.
<br /><br />
I'm also trying to make an effort to expand my interests, especially my programming interests, beyond just the narrow field of compilers and programming languages. While I enjoy this field a lot and will probably do some more work later on, I feel like I'm starting to box myself in by only focusing on compiler implementation in C++. For others, "boxing in" may mean something else like just focusing on one web framework, but the point is the same. If you are not able to expand beyond your field, you run the risk of making yourself so specialized that only a few people can use you. Of course, over-generalizing is the opposite extreme, but generalizing to a point is healthy, and in computer science where all the areas are quite diverse but also overlap, generalizing and generating a lot of value is easy.
<br /><br />
I haven't worked on any large projects in about a month and half at this point, and so far I don't see anything particular big on the horizon. I have a few ideas, but they are just ideas at the moment. I've been spending my limited free time in the past week experimenting with web development, particularly a combination of PHP and ordinary HTML with Bootstrap. I'm also thinking about doing some smaller Python projects, and possibly a few more intense VHDL projects. But as I said: most of these are just thoughts, and will probably not lead to much more than small toy projects at the moment.
<br /><br />
I've largely abandoned my regular posting schedule for now partly so I can do these smaller experiments. That said, I hope to post some of the results of these experiments to this site, so I hope you will come back and stay tuned!
