Staying busy is not usually a huge issue for me. In the almost seven years since I've started programming, I've worked on a wide variety of projects. While many of them are simple exploratory projects, some have evolved into usable applications.

However, software isn't the only thing I do. I have several other interests as well. This page is the "home page", if you will, of all my projects.
