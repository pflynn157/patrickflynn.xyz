You may be wondering, of all the areas of computer science, how did I end up going into compilers?

This question is actually a little hard for me to answer because I don't really remember how I began. Or why. I started down my compiler path over the summer before college by writing a simple BASIC interpreter. But even then, parsing wasn't new to me. My last project before the BASIC interpreter was a spreadsheet application. It included formulas, which required some fair knowledge of parsing. I ended up applying this to write the interpreter since parsing a mathematical spreadsheet formula isn't terribly different from a variable expression.

Now that I've thought about it, I think it stems from two areas: my strong interest in programming languages, and my equally strong interest in hardware architectures.

If you scroll through my Github page, you will notice that I've played with a lot of languages. Yes, most of what's there is C++, but I have tried to make things in other languages. Over the past year of covid19, I've dived deeper into this, trying some new languages including Ada and Rust. But I don't only like to try languages. I like to design my own to. To me, there's very little as satisfying as designing a language, implementing it, and seeing a program written in it build and run like any other program on your computer. And its also very challenging. You may think its easy to design a language, but when you start trying to write anything more complicated than "Hello World", you'll realize this isn't so.

I also love working close to the hardware. I really like doing things in assembly, but I don't love writing it. Therefore, I write a compiler to do it for me. I find hardware architectures very interesting- basically how the machine works and does things. I also find it really interesting how a certain programming construct can map to a hardware instruction (or some cases, a group of instructions). Pretty much all my compilers predominately target x86, but I have targeted Arm and RISC-V in the past, which was a lot of fun.

All areas of computer science have merit, and even if you aren't in compilers, you may have different reasons for why you chose your area. But this is why I love this area so much.
