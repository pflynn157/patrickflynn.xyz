It's been a while since I've posted here, but more on that later! For a start, I wish to share to the lunar eclipse that was visible here in North Carolina on Tuesday, November 8. I'll also put these in a photography area of this site later.

There are four photos. Two are closeups and two are with no zoom. Of those four, two each are normal shots and two each are night shots.
