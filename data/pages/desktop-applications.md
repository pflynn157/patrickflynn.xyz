Desktop applications were one of the first areas I delved into when I got into computer science. Even now, I still really enjoy working on them, though admittedly, I don't work on them to the extent I used to. Below are screenshots of my favorite desktop applications, with some of the features and links to the source.

If you browse my [Github profile](https://github.com/pflynn157), there are many other desktop applications in addition to these, but these are my favorites and best.

### CppEditor

This program is probably the oldest that I still maintain. As you can tell, its a text/code editor. It has a lot of features, including:

- Syntax highlighting for most languages (via KDE Syntax Highlighting)
- Auto-indent
- Intelligent auto-indent (mainly bracket matching for certain languages)
- Multi-document interface
- Project view
- Support for most platforms

### CppSheets

Even now, a few years later, this is one of my favorite applications of all time. It's a spreadsheet application written completely from scratch (using the Qt5 libraries). Some of the features include:

- Multi-document interface, with multi-sheet support within a document
- Cell formatting
- MS Excel compatible formulas
- Custom file format
- Basic, yet workable support for MS Excel files
- CSV loading support

### CppMediaPlayer

This application is another favorite of mine. As its highly original name suggests, its a media application. It uses the Qt5 Multimedia library, which allows it to play most media formats on any platform. It has many of the features you'd expect of a multimedia application. Its also cross-platform- I've had little issue building it on Linux, Windows, or MacOS.

### Odyssey

This application is yet another favorite with an interesting story behind it. As its name suggests, its a file explorer, but only for Linux, unlike my other applications. I wrote this a few years ago over a two day period- virtually the entire thing. At the time, I had caught a cold, so I staved off my boredom by writing this. After all, why rest when you have the time off... Anyway. Below are some of the features:

- Tabs (If you are a Linux or Mac user, you will know how great these are)
- Theme icon support (pulls from the current theme)
- Icon by mimetype (pulls from theme)
- Button and text address bars
- History support (used with the back button)
- Full cut/copy/paste support, across tabs and with multiple files
- Trash support (move to trash and restore from trash)
- Application chooser for files (based on mimetype)
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Places sidebar
- Drive list (harddrive, usb drive, cd, etc)
- Background refresh
