Hello everyone!

My name is Patrick Flynn, and I’m a graduate student studying computer science and living in Charlotte, North Carolina. I’m a research assistant at the university, and I’ve previously worked as a research intern at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. I specialize in compilers, programming languages, and lately have done various hardware projects including two working CPU cores. Professionally, I work in the high performance computing area.

While I spend plenty of time programming, I also enjoy a variety of other topics. I enjoy reading, writing (both blogging and my feeble attempts at creative writing), photography, puzzles, interesting political ideas, debates over technology and people, and languages. When I say languages, I mean real languages. I’ve been studying French for a few months now, and I’ve dabbled in the fascinating world of constructed languages. I also used to be into radio control, but since moving to Charlotte I’ve drifted out of that.

If any of this interests you, I hope you stick around. I try to publish weekly, so check back often. Feel free to visit the contact page if you wish to say hi!

Enjoy!
