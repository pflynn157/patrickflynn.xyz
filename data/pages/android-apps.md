Web and app development are generally my two least favorite areas of computer science. The reasons are because I hate trying to design a user interface (other than desktops applications, which are pretty easy), and because I generally think the underlying design and frameworks are bad. However, when I got my Android phone back in 2018, being the geek that I am, I had to try to program it.

To date, I've written three Android apps, two of which are here. I couldn't find screenshots for the third, and its not that interesting anyway.

Update: For some reason, the screenshots totally disappeared...

### Notepad

This was my first Android application- I wrote it a month or so after getting the phone. And what's interesting about it is that I've had it (and used it quite often) on all my phones since, even though I've never updated it.

Notepad is a simple note-taking application. I originally wrote it partly to learn, but mainly because Android has no native notepad like iOS, and because I was having a hard time finding something in the app store that A) worked, and B) wasn't riddled with ads.

### Block Planner

Source: (email me if you're interested :) )

This is a simple planning application I wrote for my tablet. My planning is split between paper and digital. When I write out outlines or do more extensive plans, I still use paper. But things like my daily checklist, my daily plan, and my calendar are all digital, generally on my tablet. I use the block planning method, and since I couldn't find anything on the app store to meet my needs, I wrote my own.
