Puzzles is yet another one of my diverse hobbies. I tend to work on puzzles as a decompression hobby, and I tend to do them in spurts, meaning I'll put a puzzle together fairly quickly and then not work on one for a while. Anyway.

You could make the argument that programming is a puzzle. Maybe that's why I like jigsaw puzzles so much... :)
