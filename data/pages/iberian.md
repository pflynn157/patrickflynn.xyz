Iberian is a new constructed language I've been working on. It has some similarities to my previous one, but there are some key differences. In particular, I feel like this one is more complete. The lexicon and the examples are still a work in process, but I'll get there.

The reasoning behind the language, the grammar, and initial lexicon can be found in the PDF on this page. This language is still a work in progress. If you have any suggestions, [please contact me](/contact.html).
