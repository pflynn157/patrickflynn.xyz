This is a log (more of a partial log...) of my reading. I'm putting this here partially for me to keep track, and partially for anyone else who is interested. I go through reading spurts, meaning that I will read a lot for a few months, then read nothing for another few. I know... I'm trying to establish a regular reading habit, but when I have a lot of stuff going on, sometimes that's easier said than done :) But anyway...

I'm not going to write full reviews or summaries, but I will put a rating to the side. If the book is especially good, I'll post a review on it. Also, some of the books I have on here may be political in nature, so please don't take offense at it or my rating. I read books like this to learn.
